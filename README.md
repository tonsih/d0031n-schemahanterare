# Schemahanterare (D0031N - Examination Assignment)

This repository contains the code and resources for an LTU project developed as
part of the D0027E course. The project introduces a web application that acts
as an intermediary between TimeEdit and Canvas, automating course scheduling at
LTU. The web application enables course coordinators to directly register
courses and provides functionalities to modify, add, or remove course details
retrieved from TimeEdit, and submit the data to a Canvas calendar.

This repository includes:

-   **Playwright Java Application**: Populates a database with all currently
    active courses from LTU's TimeEdit. This application was developed to
    bypass the lack of direct access to TimeEdit's API.

-   **Frontend**: A web application client developed using React, with Vite
    serving as the build tool and development environment. TypeScript is used
    for scripting the React components. Note: The Playwright library is
    included (original tests are omitted due to changes in schedule data).

-   **Backend**: A REST API that provides TimeEdit course data from the
    database, built with Java SpringBoot.

-   **Database**: Includes the necessary PostgreSQL SQL scripts to construct
    the schema and populate the database with course data from the CSV file
    generated by the Playwright application.

## Features

-   **Data Retrieval**: Retrieves all currently active courses and calendar
    events from LTU's TimeEdit system to the web application.

-   **Event Management**: Allows registration and modification of events via
    the web application and the ability to send the events to the Canvas
    calendar (API access key required for the Canvas account).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

-   Node.js: The project requires Node.js version 18.16.0 LTS or higher. You can
    download and install the latest LTS version of Node.js from the official
    Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org). This will also
    install npm (Node Package Manager) along with Node.js.

-   Canvas API Access Key: The client presents a field to input the API access
    key. This key is necessary for successfully transferring the scheduled data
    to Canvas.
